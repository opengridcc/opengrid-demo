    "# Multi-variable linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The multivariable linear regression analysis is used to create a model of a single variable, typically an energy consumption. We call this the *dependent* variable y.  The model is constructed as a linear combination of *explanatory* or *independent* variables (x), like weather measurements or occupation. More information can be found on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression\" target=\"_blank\">wikipedia</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is static.  This means that the data set should not contain dynamic effects.  For buildings, dynamic effects are mostly neglegible on a weekly basis unless the building has a very high thermal inertia.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical use of this analysis is to create a model of eg. the gas consumption of a building, and then use this model to detect and quantify changes in the gas consumption.  For example, the savings resulting from a new gas boiler can be computed as the difference between the consumption predicted by the model and the actual consumption. \n"
