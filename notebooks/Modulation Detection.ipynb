    "Some condensing gas boilers have the ability to *modulate*, this means that they can adjust the power of the burn. In short: while heating a building, the boiler will start of at maximum power and will gradually lower the power as the temperature of the water in the pipes rises. This allows the boiler to burn longer, at a higher efficiency. (gas boilers are more efficient at lower power)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you know a boiler has the capability of modulation, you can increase the efficiency ever further by adjusting the settings so it only starts its burn at a lower power. However it takes longer to get the building up to temperature. You can set your thermostat so it starts the heating cycle earlier, or a smart thermostat will automatically do this for you.\n",

    "The aim of this analysis is to use detailed gas consumption data to detect the power level at which a certain gas boiler modulates."
